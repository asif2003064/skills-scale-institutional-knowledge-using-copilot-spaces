# RACI Matrix Template

A RACI matrix defines who is **Responsible**, **Accountable**, **Consulted**, and **Informed** for key activities and deliverables in OctoAcme projects.

---

## RACI Definitions

- **R - Responsible**: The person(s) who do the work to complete the task
- **A - Accountable**: The person ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion (only one A per task)
- **C - Consulted**: People who provide input and whose opinions are sought (two-way communication)
- **I - Informed**: People who are kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)

## How to Use This Template

1. **Customize for your project**: Not all projects require all roles. Remove columns for roles not involved in your project.

2. **Add project-specific activities**: Include any specialized deliverables or activities unique to your project.

3. **Review with the team**: Share the RACI matrix during project kickoff to ensure clarity and alignment.

4. **Keep it updated**: As roles or responsibilities change, update the matrix and communicate changes to the team.

5. **Resolve conflicts**: If multiple people are marked as Accountable (A) for a task, clarify ownership to avoid confusion.

6. **Use for onboarding**: Share this matrix with new team members to help them understand their responsibilities.

## Tips for Effective RACI Usage

- **One Accountable per activity**: Avoid diffusion of responsibility by having exactly one person accountable for each task.
- **Limit Consulted roles**: Too many people in "Consulted" can slow down decision-making.
- **Balance Responsible assignments**: Distribute work fairly across team members.
- **Review regularly**: Update the RACI matrix as the project evolves and team composition changes.
- **Use in conjunction with other docs**: Reference this matrix alongside the roles and personas document for complete clarity.
